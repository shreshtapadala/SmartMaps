# SmartMaps - Travel Wisely and Responsibly

This project is created for the Microsoft Future Ready Talent Virtual Internship Program.

<b>Title :</b> SmartMaps - Travel Wisely and Responsibly

<b>Industry :</b> Earth

<br>

SmartMaps aims to provide a more environmentally conscious way of navigating. While traditional maps help with directions, they don't show the environmental impact of different travel options. SmartMaps addresses this by:

- Showing the carbon footprint for different routes and modes of transportation.
- Recommending the most eco-friendly travel options.
- Offering weather updates for specific locations.
- Providing a user-friendly interface with traditional mapping features like navigation, location search, and traffic updates.
- Including speech functionality to read information aloud to users.

By using SmartMaps, users can make informed decisions about their travel, reduce their environmental impact, and promote responsible travel practices.

### Project Demo Link : https://salmon-dune-03bdbef00.5.azurestaticapps.net
### Project Demo Video Link : https://youtu.be/TlMrBU-4SII

<br>

### Problem Statement : 
Travel is an essential part of human life, but it contributes significantly to environmental pollution. Traditional maps often overlook providing information about the environmental impact of different travel modes. SmartMaps addresses this problem by offering navigation through various transport options, highlighting their carbon footprint, and recommending the optimal eco-friendly travel route to promote responsible travel.

<br>

### Project Description :
The core idea of SmartMaps is to revolutionize how people navigate their travel by integrating traditional mapping functionalities with environmental awareness features like carbon footprint calculations. This helps bring awareness to users about the environmental impacts of their journey, promoting responsible travel.

<br>

### Key Features

#### Traditional Mapping Functionalities : 
- Navigation
- Location Search
- Different Map Styles
- Traffic Flow Information
- Map Controls (Zooming In/Out, Adjusting Pitch, Rotating Map)
  
#### Environmental Awareness Features :

- Carbon Footprint Calculation for Different Travel Routes
- Recommendation for Optimal Eco-Friendly Travel Route
- Weather Information for Any Location

#### Enhancing User Experience :

- Speech Functionality that Reads Information to the User

<br>

### Purpose and Functionality :
SmartMaps addresses the crucial need for environmentally responsible travel by providing users with the information necessary to make informed decisions. By leveraging Azure services, SmartMaps enables users to understand the environmental impacts of their journeys, compare the carbon footprints across various travel options and recieve recommendations for eco-friendly routes. All these features are integrated into a familiar mapping interface to encourage users to travel wisely and responsibly.
